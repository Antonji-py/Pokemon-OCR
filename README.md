Light Python script to scan and add your Pokemon cards during opening. For database we use google sheets and data about prices is from cardmarket.com. There are only few packs you have to install in order to use this script

To start up you have to make credentials file for Google Sheets API. Tim has uploaded nice video showing how to do -> https://youtu.be/cnPlKLEGR7E 0:31. Next what you should do is install modules by typing `pip install requirements.txt`

For any questions please open issue on GitHub. Enjoy :)
